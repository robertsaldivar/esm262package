#` Population Growth Rate with Harvest
#`
#` This function determines the intrinsic population growth rate of a population, if that population is being harvested/hunted
#`.
#` @param growth rate is the rate the population grows, default = 0.05
#` @param carrying capacity is that the number of indiviuals of a population that a habitat can support, default = 2000
#` @param attack rate is the rate that hunters can attack and harvest an individual of the population, default = 0.05
#` @param handling time is the amount of time that it takes for a hunter to havest one individual before they they can harvest the next one, default = 0.2
#` @input population is the population size
#` @input hunters is the number of hunters harvesting the the population. To find th growth rate of the population with out harvest, set hunters to 0
#` @return, is the intrinsic growth rate of the population at a given size with a give harvesting rate.
